# random-number-generator

Hey! This is a college work for simulation and models subject where we needed to create a code to simulate random generation methods like middle square method and middle multiplication method. Those methods were simultated using Node JS. To run them you need the following:

1. You need to have Node and npm installed in your PC. <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">Download Node</a> (Latest LTS Version: 18.15.0 includes npm 9.5.0)
2. You need to have git installed to clone this repository. <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Download git</a>
3. Clone this repository by running the following command in your cli:
```
git clone https://github.com/Santiago-Restrepo/random-number-generator.git
```
4. Move to the cloned folder and then install project dependencies with npm:
```
cd random-number-generator
npm i
```
5. After installing project dependencies just run the code with the following command: 
```
npm start
```
--------

After that you should see a prompt that will ask you for what method you want to use and the respective inputs of that method ðŸš€
